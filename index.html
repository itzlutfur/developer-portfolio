            <h3>I am a developer</h3>
            <p class="about-me">I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and
                to
                experience.
                I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I
                like
                to
                see the sunrise
                in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I
                like to
                smell the wind coming
                from the ocean.
